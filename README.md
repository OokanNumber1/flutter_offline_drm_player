# Flutter Offline DRM Playback POC

This demonstrates a Flutter plugin for offline DRM playback for Flutter apps using Exoplayer. 

## Screen recording:

The video below demonstrates the following:
- Playing an online unencrypted audio file
- Playing an online encrypted audio file
- Playing an offline encrypted audio file (this is downloaded when playing the online encrypted audio file)

## Note:
This is a proof of concept and is not production ready. It is not recommended to use this in production apps.
